# The Self-Simulational Theory of temporal extension from the perspective of the Free Energy Principle #

Abstract
The self-simulational theory of temporal extension (SST) describes an information-theoretically formalized 
mechanism by which the ‘width’ of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the 
emergence of subjective temporal extension from first principles of the physics of self-organization and to formalize subjective temporal extension using information geometry. Using active inference, a deep
parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described 
dynamics on a computational level. Two ‘biases’ (i.e., variations) of time-perception naturally emerge 
from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e., the 
compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory 
consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep states 
of meditative absorption (i.e., in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic
and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a 
unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the 
respective domains. This concerns, next to more general attentional and 
central tendency effects, the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, near death-experiences, and various psychopathologies, amongst others. The self-simulational 
theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the 'width' of the
subjective temporal moment emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, 
subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational 
mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.

An in-depth explanation of the generative model and specific architectural choices can be found in the paper (i.e., https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12895). For an earlier version of SST, see also: https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2023/1/niad015/7202197.
